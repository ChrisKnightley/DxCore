`!` - USART2 does not have XCK and XDIR pins available on it's alternate mapping.

## Notes
* See the Wire.h library readme for details on the pinmappings of the TWI/I2C peripherals, as there are up to three pinsets, but two of those are limited to only one mode.
* TCBs can be used either for millis or a single PWM channel each; they are also used by libraries like Servo.h and the `tone()` functioun. They are very good millis timers, and it is recommended to use the default, TCB2 for that purpose, not for PWM.
* The Type A timers (TCA0 and TCA1) can be mapped to different pins as a group only - you can set TCA0 to output on any port's pin 0-5, and TCA1 to PORTB or PORTG (the configurations on pins 4-6 of PORTC or PORTE are not supported - too much overhead every time analogWrite or digitalWrite is called). Using this feature is easy - all you need to do is `PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA` and then analogWrite() normally.

It is strongly recommended to not have any PWM output enabled involving either the timer being moved nor the pins it is being moved to when setting `PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA`. In the latter case, you will not be able to turn off the existing PWM through the API functions.
```c
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTF_gc | PORTMUX_TCA1_PORTG_gc; // PWM on PORTF and PORTG pins 0-5
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = (PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA & PORTMUX_TCA0_gm) | PORTMUX_TCA1_PORTG; // Move TCA1 PWM to PORTG but don't change TCA0
// The first option is slightly faster, as it isn't a read-modify-write.
// Note that PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTA_gc and PORTMUX_TCA1_PORTB_gc have a numeric value of 0.
```
* The Type D timer, TCD0, has 2 output channels (WOA and WOB) and 4 output pins (WOA, WOB, WOC, and WOD). The hardware permits WOC and WOD to each output either WOA or WOB, but this added too much complexity to analogWrite; WOA and WOC output WOA, and WOD and WOB output WOB. Calling analogWrite() on either pin will enable it, calling digitalWrite() on that pin will turn the PWM off. Calling analogWrite() on WOC while already outputting on the WOA pin will result in both pins outputting the new duty cycle. Call digital write on first pin if this is not what you want. The datasheet describes TCD0 output on PA4-7, PB4-7, PF0-3, and PG4-7. What the datasheet giveth, the errata taketh away; the alternate pin options are hopelessly broken currently, only PA4-7 work.
* Thus, the absolute maximum number of independent PWM outputs at any given time is 19: 6 each on the two TCA's, 2 from the TCD, and 1 each from the 5 TCB's. This does not count the third limited-functionality PWM channel that can be smuggled out of the TCD using PROGEV event and delay options.
* Following precedent set by MegaCoreX, we declare that pin 7 - `PIN_PA7` shall be the pin that the core "expects" to be connected to an LED. LED_BUILTIN is defined as that pin, and the bootloader will set that pin as output and try to blink the LED. Note that if the bootloader is not used, and your sketch does not reference `LED_BUILTIN` this pin is not otherwise treated any differently. This can be overridden if a custom board definition is created by passing `-DLED_BUILTIN = (some other pin)` in the `build.extra_flags` field.
* Reset (PF6) can be set to work as an input (but never an output). The UPDI pin cannot be configured as an I/O pin.
* Only pins on PORTD and PORTE can be used as the negative side of a differential analog reading (`analogReadDiff()`). Pins on PORTF can be used as positive or single ended ADC inputs only.

## Datasheets
There is no difference in the datasheets for the different flash sizes. The errata, however, is drastically different. This is partly due to the errata being incomplete, but also due to the fact that the 128k size was released first, several bugs were fixed, and then the smaller flash sizes were released.
