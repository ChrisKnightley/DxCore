# Overall information regarding the AVR Dx-series
In early 2020, as the world was shutting down because of COVID-19, Microchip released the first of their new generation of parts. Along with many exciting features, it also brought one odd relic: a single nail, the meaning of which was clear when the naming of the parts was announced. That was last nail in the coffin of the ATmega branding, and it has been driven securely into place. The Dx and Ex-series have replaced it. The next question is how much longer tinyAVR has. There may well not be anything else called an ATtiny in the future either. Now that the company is no longer ATmel, why would they keep the AT-prefixed brands? And of course, since Microchip has all the creativity that you'd expect from a company that makes microchips and is named Microchip, the new naming system is uncreative in the extreme: AVRffXYpp - where ff is a number, the flash size in kb, XY are two capital letters indicating the chip generation, and family (likely both generation and family will generally go in alphabetical order, with a possible exception for USB-native parts, which could get a U (per the withdrawn DU-series brief) - I imagine "DC" was skipped because that has an obvious meaning in electronics. They will probably skip "F" as a generation letter, too, F being a failing grade in school, not to mention it's association with a certain explitive. Certainly, if there is an Fx-series, they'd have to pick some other letter for the family with native USB support. An FU-series wouldn't be a marketing success story.

## Specifications of AVR Dx-series parts by family and pincount
~Strikethrough~ value is hypothetical assuming datasheet reflected the available silicon. Non-struckthrough values are actual values after considering all outstanding errata.

Notes:
* Figures for EA-series are varying degrees of speculative. I am skeptical that there is a second TWI on the 48-pin EA parst, and some sources say no USART2 either. Time will tell
* Fully astync pins may exceed input pins on the previous line. This is the case when all I/O pins are fully async, even the ones that require disabling reset and UPDI to use. It is *not* clear whether on DA/DB parts reset set as input is also fully async.
* For (V)QFN and (T)QFP packages my normal shorthand is used: `AxBmm .Cp` where A and B are the dimensions in millimeters of the package (except height, go read the datasheet if you need to know that), and C is the pin pitch also in mm (including the preceding decimal point of course)
* Event system channel outputs are available on pins 2 and 7 of each port (except on AVR128DAs, where PE4-7 and PB6-7 are "not connected to the event system" according to the errata. , but only one of those per port can be used at one time, though any EVSYS generator can be used by any port with EVOUT pins. Hence this table shows two numbers for the output pins: the first number is the number of simultaneously usable output pins, and the second, after the slash, is the number of total EVOUT pins. Each port input to EVSYS can be used by at most two EVSYS channels (on Dx-series, Ex-series allows every port to generate two event inputs that can be used by any channel). See [the Event library documentation](../libraries/Event/README.md) for more information.
* On the AVR DD-series, one of the output pins cannot be used unless UPDI is fused as GPIO, as PF7 is UPDI, and an event output option if used as GPIO. This feature is not available on other AVR Dx-series parts.
* Each CCL LUT is associated with not more than 1 port, which may or may not be present on that part, having inputs on the first 3 pins, and output on pin 4 or 6. LUTs without pins can still be used with internal inputs, which is the more interesting application of them. LUTs are associated with, in order, PORTA, PORTC, PORTD, PORTF, PORTB, and PORTG. There is no LUT associated with PORTE. Even and odd-numbered LUTs are not equal: Even LUTs determine the clock for the sequential logic (if used), and can use their own output (or the output of sequential logic, if used) as their inputs. Odd LUTs must use an event channel to get their own output, but can use the output of the even LUT. All CCL LUTs must be disabled in order to reconfigure any one LUT. See [the Logic library documentation](../libraries/Logic/README.md) for more information.
* A LUT can be sacrificed to simply output an event channel if needed, or an EVOUT pin can be used to output the value of a LUT.
* Neither EVSYS nor LUT channel values can be read directly by software.
* AC output can only be on pins PA7 or PC6. ZCD output can only be on pins PA7 or PC7. The AC's on DA/DB parts can each use a subset of the pins on PD and PE. The AC on DD-series can also use a pair of pins on PC as inputs if MVIO is disabled. ZCD inputs are fixed, and output MUXing is broken on DA-series parts and cannot be set individually. See [the Comparator](../libraries/Comparator/README.md) or [ZCD library](../libraries/ZCD/README.md) documentation for more information.
* The DAC always outputs on PD6. This cannot be remapped. It cannot be internally routed to the OPAMPs on the DB-series, despite the documentation implying that it can be.
* Analog input is available on all pins of PORTD, PORTE, and pins on PORTF that are neither RESET nor UPDI. On DD-series only, PORTA pins can be used, and pins on PORTC for analog inputs (to ADC, and comparator for PC2/3) ONLY if MVIO is disabled.
* The AVR Dx-series ADC is only kinda-sorta differential. In differential mode, the maximum voltage on both pins must be lower than the reference voltage (making it equivalent to having 2 ADCs and simultaneously starting a conversion on both and taking the difference; you can't use a lower reference voltage to "zoom in" on a difference between two voltages where one or both is higher than the reference. On a true differential ADC, like is slated for the EA-series, that is valid). See [the analog reference](Ref_Analog.md) for more information.
* For TCAs, only pins on a single port can be used at any one time. The number of pins on each mux option is shown for parts with only one TCA. It becomes too cumbersome to list in the table (not to mention rather less critical - the 48+ pin parts have enough PWM capable pins that you probably don't have to worry).
* The third number on max simultaneous PWM outputs is if you go balls to the wall, and use
* The RESET pin can be used as an input (PF6) instead of reset. It cannot be used as an output, ever.
* The UPDI pin can be used as an input or output (PF7) instead of UPDI, requiring HV programming to reprogram. After an HV override of that pin.
* The OPAMPs have fixed pin mapping. All pins are always available on parts that have builtin OPAMPs.
* (SPI, USART, TWI) Only pin mappings which are not missing the "primary" pins (TX and RX for USART, SCK, MOSI and MISO for SPI) are included for those peripherals. For TWI, options that are strictly inferior are not included in that count (this would include the case where only the dual mode pins are available, and those pins are the full function pins on another multiplexing option which does not provide dual mode pins. This happens to TWI0 on DD14, or where the a multiplexing option has the same full function pins as another mux option but no dual mode pins). In these cases, that mux option cannot do anything that cannot be done by another option which offers more functionality, and is not counted here.
* `*` This package variant not yet seen in the wild for all sizes. Specifically, we have yet to see :
  * VQFN version of the AVR64DD20. This is also NOT listed as an available package on the preliminary datasheet, and may not be planned.
  * VQFN version of the AVR32DD32, AVR16DD32, AVR32DD28 and AVR16DD28
  * PDIP version of the AVR32DD28 and AVR16DD28
* `**` Only 2 independent TCD timer channels exist, but are distributed in groups of 4. Within each group, 2 pins are bound to a specific  channel, while the other to can choose - though DxCore does not expose the ability to for pin C to output pwm B nor pin D to output pwm A. On DA and DB-series parts, current errata leaves only the first group of pins functional. The DD-series has 2 pins which appear in two groups (PA4 and PA5). The AVR DA-series is impacted by errata that prevent the PORTG mapping from working.
* `!!` Flash endurance was initially spec'ed at 10k for all Dx-series parts. Shortly before the release of the DD-series, they issued an erratum ("it's broken, but we'll fix it some day, maybe") for the DA/DB parts, which was subsequently changed to a "datasheet clarification" ("it's broken, and we ain't gonna fix it") - presumably their investigation concluded that there was no ready solution (likely this is related to the word-write capability that these parts have). The DD-series was released with the datasheet specifying 1k rewrite cycles. If the limit in realisic conditions of use is 1k, that is low enough that it would constrain use of the devices in cases which relied frequent self-programming. What isn't clear though is whether the lower limit is only observed in adverse conditions (I am of the understanding that tempeature has an impact) or if even mild and typical conditions will see such low endurance. It obviously brings consideration of the flash endurance to the table in a lot of scenarios where it could normally be neglected.
* There are large differences between the errata impacting the available hardware DA and DB parts (with DBs having less), and with the 128k flash versions having more than the smaller flash versions - they were released first. The AVR128DB also received a package of fixes almost immediately, likely due to a severe bug impacting the ADC when making single-ended measurements, and two problems with the OPAMPs in the initial silicon (A4 revision). Very few of those made it into the wild - even the parts I had that arrived before the preliminary datasheet had even been posted are A5. The DD-series has very little errata.
* Pricing is from late 2022 and obviously subject to change. Industrial temp spec, not in tape, least expensive package variant (see below - either QFN of TQFP, unless 14 pin parts which only have SOP option Microchip Direct, without any of the (significant) quantity discounts), non-VAO version.

## Big Picture
These parts depart from the naming scheme used for AVR devices in the past; these are named AVR followed by the size of the flash, in KB, followed by DA, DB, or DD (depending on the "series" or "family", then the number of pins. Note that the pin count also determines how many of certain peripherals the parts have available - parts with more pins have more peripherals to do things with those pins. 64-pin parts are not available in 32k flash size. The 128k flash size is the highest that can be supported with a 16-bit program counter (above that, a number of instructions become slower, and everything gets more complicated), and with the current scheme for interacting with the pins, the 55 I/O pins (56 less the UPDI pin which takes the place of PF7) are the limit of what a modern AVR can accommodate while allowing single cycle access to all pins - so these take them to the top end of what is possible without extensions to the architecture.

At present, there are three lines of AVR Dx-series parts currently available: The "baseline" DA, the DB with multivoltage (MVIO) and on-chip OPAMPs, and the "budget" DD-series which has MVIO but otherwise far fewer peripherals, and is available in pincounts as low as 14, bringing them dangerouly close to the tinyAVR parts (dangerous for the tinyAVRs, that is). There is *potentially* a new "DU" series with DD-like low pincounts in the works.  Which instead of `MVIO`, sacrifice most of `PORTC` in the name of **native USB**. In 2021, a product brief was available but as the name suggests, it was available only *briefly*. It's unclear if the document was withdrawn because the chip will not go into production, will not exist in the form described in that document, or if they just afraid that if they put up a product brief years before the product launched (as they have done with the DD and EA), that news of an impending DU-series with native USB would hurt sales of their existing native USB AVRs, (Mainly the aging ATmega32u4 and it's even less capable ATmega__u2 siblings).Hopefully they haven't canceled the native USB modern AVR thing altogether.  As long as there is a native USB modern AVR in the not-too-distant future, I'll be happy with any plausible configuration. The prospect of a new, more capable AVR with native USB is exciting indeed, since the 32u4 feels positively ancient to work with compared to a modern AVR. This core supports the DA, DB, and DD-series and pending availability, will support the EA-series unless the scale of changes there is greater than expected and a separate core is required (since that was written, headers have been released for the EA, and they make it clear that there is no cause for concern on that front - the big differences are a return to tinyAVR-like clock generation and flash writing, event system improved such that all channels are interchangible (finally), in addition to them receiving the highly anticipated tinyAVR 2-series-like ADC). If/when The DU-series materializes, they would also fall under the perview of this core.

### DA-series
The "baseline" full-size parts - however much I was in awe of these when they were first released, having seen the DB-series, it now appears that these are more akin to a 0-series than a 1-series - in every arena, the DB has the same or better. They do not support using an external crystal for the main clock, like the other Dx parts do, but the internal oscillator on these parts is still WAY better than the classic AVRs had - all the ones I've tested are weithin half a percent at room temp and typical operating voltages, even without autotune... To make sure autotune was working, I had to point a torch at it, because I couldn't get enough of a change in the internal oscillator frequency from changing the supply voltage - in fact, it didn't seem to change at all. It is also the only currently announced Dx series without `MVIO`. While they may not shine as brightly next to the other Dx lines. The fact that these look less than stellar beside the DB doesn't change the fact that *they absolutely bury any AVR from before 2020*. There is only one thing that they have and the DB doesn't - a peripheral touch controller (which we can't use in Arduino land because they won't share the source code and force you to use their IDE in order to make use of it).

### DB-series
The DB-series is almost an exact copy of the DA-series (they fixed some of the most egregious silicon bugs, but only some), with a few even more exciting features tacked on: Support for a real high-frequency crystal as clock source (finally - first time since the modern AVR architecture was released in 2016), "MVIO" (multivoltage I/O), where PORTC can run at a different voltage than the rest of the chip (essentially, a builtin bidirectional level shifter). The other "headline feature", is the  two (28/32-pin parts) or three (48/64-pin parts) on-chip opamps, with software-controlled MUX for the inputs and an on-chip feedback resistor ladder. These can be used as gain stage for the ADC, for example, or to buffer the DAC output (though these opamps can't supply **that** much current, they can supply tens of mA, instead of ~ 1 like the unaided DAC), and connected to each other for multistage amplifiers (on parts with 3, you can even connect them together as an instrumentation amplifier). The included `<Opamp.h>` library provides a minimalist wrapper around them exposing all of the functionality.

### DD-series
The DD-series is a smaller-pincount lower priced product line; parts are available with 14-32 pins. They've got the `MVIO` (3 or 4 MVIO pins depending on pincount), and the UPDI pin can be configured as an I/O pin (in this case, further UPDI programming requires an HV pulse to be applied to the *reset* pin, while the reset pin, like the DA and DB parts, can be configured only as reset or input. (This sidesteps the awkward problem that tinyAVR has of "How do I put an HV pulse on the reset pin when it's an output being driven low?") One thing worth noting is that the 28-pin and 32-pin DD-series parts are, but for expanded port multiplexing options for `SPI0`, `USART0`, and the addition of ADC input functionality on pins in `PORTA` and `PORTC`, and the fact that it actually fixed the longstanding errata on modern AVRs. It's a DB with fewer copies of peripherals and no opamps.

I expect the 14 and 20 pin parts to be very popular popular among hobbyists but that the 28 and 32-pin ones will be quite popular with cost-conscious commercial users, as they offer a significant discount compared to the DA/DB parts.  DB's for the higher pincounts.

It's worth noting also that the DD28, unlike the DB28, is available in a VQFN28 package (4x4mm, 0.4mm pitch) Will that be a hobbyist choice? No. But will manufacturers love it? Yes. Especially at that price.

If you were hoping to use a tinyAVR breakout board for the 14 or 20-pin versions, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the tinyAVR boards won't work. They swapped power and ground on the SOIC packages vis-a-vis tinyAVR, and the layout of the VQFN20 is different than the 20-pin tinyAVRs. The 28 and 32 pin parts are pin compatible with AVR-DB - but as I said, I don't think anyone is super excited about a poverty model DB unless they desperately need more flexible PORTMUX (or can't lay their hands on any DBs due to the agonizingly long backorder waiting lists). Actually, no, I don't hate being the bearer of this news. In fact, it brings me joy - I sell breakout boards, remember? And now everyone's going to need different ones than they'd been using for 14 and 20 pin tinyAVR parts!

### EA-series
The EA-series is known only from it's product brief, and now some rather sparse headers. It looks like it is the first example of a new generation. Except for the whole lower maximum clock speed thing, that I don't get... It looks like it's internal oscillator is tinyAVR-like... According to the product brief it will be available only in 28, 32, and 48 pin packages, with up to 64k of flash - or as little as 8k (implying it is at least in part aimed at dragging the users of the old ATmega8 and such into the modern era, kicking and screaming), no Type D timer, but in exchange, there will be dual type A timers in all pincounts (confirmed by headers, with new 5-6-7 mappings for multiple ports) and it will feature the 12-bit true differential ADC with programmable gain amplifier that the tinyAVR 2-series has. The DAC appears to have some new functionality, albeit likely nothing huge. Event system looks to be getting significant changes with the laudable goal of making the channels all the same, which would make things like input capture easier but for the fact that people have written code for the current parts.

The most puzzling thing about these, though is that some of their specs like the oscillator seem to represent a step backwards. On the third hand, they will represent YET ANOTHER version of the NVM controller, being the first modern AVR to advertise NRWW and RWW sections of flash - but again, many would argue it's a step backwards- it is much more like the tinyAVR and megaAVR 0-series than the AVR Dx.  We can expect that programming over UPDI using SerialUPDI will be able to reach high baud rates - but the effective data rate will likely remain lower than the DX-series because of the smaller page size and additional commands required to write pagewise - RWW helps, but not by nearly as much as eliminating several latency periods per page and quadrupling the size of the page like the Dx did.

### DU-series (details unconfirmed)
The DU-series was described by a product brief which was almost immediately pulled down. It described something with DD-like pincounts, MVIO replaced with USB, and no TCD. One imagines that under the hood, TCD is repurposed for the 48 MHz USB reference clock, and the MVIO is levelshifting the USB data lines to 3.3v. It feature crystalless USB, the same flash options as the DD (except no 64k 14/20 pin). It also suggested a builtin USB programming interface of some sort, which is of course very exciting news - though all USB stuff will depend on availability of reference code to write the USB modules. We look forward to the release of more information, and, evnetually, the product. I predict the DU14 and DU20 will be extremely popular.

## Timeline
128k DA-series parts were released in April 2020, followed by 32k in early summer (though the initial release of the 32k parts suffered from a fatal flaw and was recalled, working ones were not available until the end of 2020), while the 64k parts became available late in summer of 2020, around the same time as the first AVR128DB-series parts became available, while the 32 snd 64k versions of the DB arriving in the first half of 2021. The AVR DD-series product brief was released in spring of 2020, but didn't become available until two years later in June of 2022, starting with 64k parts with 28 and 32 pins, and 16 and 32k parts with 14 and 20 pins. The other versions arrived in late 2022 - though as of writing the QFN package versions of the second tranch are still not available.

## Lots of errata
The silicon errata list in the initial versions of these parts - the DA-series in particular - is... longer than you may be used to if you were accustomed to the classic AVRs. The initial DB silicon looked bad too, but right after the release, a new silicon rev was added to the errata listing which fixed the worst of the bugs present in the "first" AVR128DB rev. All the parts I've gotten had the fixes, even the ones that arrived before they'd released the datasheet... Sadly, the AVR128DA never got a corresponding pack of fixes. In both cases, the smaller flash versions, released later, incorporated fixes that the 128k parts haven't gotten. If you've been working with the tinyAVR 0/1-series, many of these errata may be old friends of yours by now. A large number of those issues appear to have sailed through the new chip design process without a remedy - and five years after the release of those parts, new silicon errata were still being acknowledged in the tinyAVR 0/1 errata and DA/DB errata simultaneously - apparently issues that were discovered on the Dx-series and then found to impact the tinyAVR 0/1-series as well.

The DD series parts have done a *much* better job on the errata. There very few issues known as of late 2022. Not that this is surprising: There was no really new ground broken by the DDs in terms of peripherals or function. Just fixing bugs, expanding mux options, and reducing cost and pincount.

See [**our errata summary**](https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore/blob/master/megaavr/extras/Errata.md) for more information.

## DD pricing
I'm sure you were all wondering about what the pricing of the DD-series parts would be like, and how it would compare to the existing Dx and tinyAVR parts. There just isn't much daylight between Dx and tinyAVR in terms of pricing, though, undermining the case for a poverty model DB.
Well, the answer is that it's closer to tinyAVR than DA/DB territory. Whether that means the extra peripherals on the DA/DB use a lot of silicon, or just have higher margins is a question only Microchip knows the answer to. Well, unless someone were to dissolve the encapsulation with nitric acid and measure the die size. Which I'm sure someone has done, but it's a near certainty that they haven't shared their findings, as the folks likely to do that are competitors looking to gain an advantage by understanding the architecture via die photography and the like. I am aware of no public images of decapped modern AVRs.

This gives prices, which (where comparable parts exist) represent a savings of around 20-27% vs the DB (the DA is only about 5% less than the DB). It's worth noting that the DD28 finally brings a 28-pin VQFN to the family, something I'm sure the product designers would have liked to see in the DA/DB parts. Nobody in production wants to use a TSSOP package unless they absolutely have to - those things are large (though not as large as a wide SOIC), and 28-pins is one of the "blind spots" in the range of common IC packages. You can see some odd patterns in the numbers emerge here, particularly that the QFP versions of the 32-pin parts are approximately equal, while those of higher-pincount devices favor the QFN. Odd isn't it?

The DD20's are, in general, oddly expensive - especially with the 28-pin QFN coming in fully 10% cheaper than the 32-pin one for only 4 fewer pins. What is more surprising though is that the QFN package isn't even LISTED in the datasheet for the 64DDs - it may never be made (is the die that big? Really? Someone pass the nitric acid and dial calipers (separately, please), let's see how big that die *actually* is `*`) - which would make the AVR64DD20 less relevant in the marketplace (where nobody wants some gigantic wide-SOIC or SSOP package) - though it won't matter as much to folks making one-off

Prices are Microchip Direct qty 1 price for the item, industrial temp range, not in tape (the taped versions cost several cents more). Quantity discounts are significant - If this document was targeting industry folks instead of hobbyists, makers and maker-entrepreneurs, I'd be comparing the 5000+ price instead). The trend would be the same. The DA-series are available in an automotive (VAO) grade (available being a funny word here, since they're backordered for 15 months), but what's really surprising is that the price of extended temp range 128DA64's is *lower* than normal, non-extended temp range, non-VAO 128DA64's/

New pincounts/package/flash combinations seem to be dribbling out, probably as production capacity allows. Evidence over the past several years has implied that Microchip has difficulty meeting demand for QFN packaged parts in general, which would explain why they are coming out later (though not why they aren't more expensive)

`*` Nitric acid is what is used to "decap" chips (dissolve the encapsulation material); it dissolves the plastic, but not the die (yes, that is plastic, not ceramic. Ceramic ICs cost a fortune, and have been rare and exotic for years). After that, one can just rinse the acid off the revealed die, and then measure it. In industrial settings, after decapping an IC with nitric acid, there are some other steps that they may use to remove the topmost layers before putting it in an electron microscope to make those beautiful die photos we've all seen. You don't need an electron microscope, though - and probably not even the dial calipers - to see whether the die size was close to the scale of the chip - but don't try this at home: Nitric acid is an extremely hazardous chemical, one that should not be used at home, without a fume hood, or anywhere except for a laboratory or industrial facility. Nitric acid is nearly impossible to get anyway for individuals - it is extremely expensive to ship (for very good reasons) and it is watched or restricted in many countries because of it's much-better-known application: It is used in manufacture of almost every high explosive.

### We got initial Ex-series headers
The EA-series ATpacks are now available from Microchip. [It has some surprises in it](EA_first_look.md)

### EA will be a big deal
In case there was ever any doubt about it:
* Brings the new ADC from the 2-series tinyAVR (apparentlty with some small changes which have yet to be detailed - some of the poorly described tunables appear to be gone, and a new feature added) to full size parts. This will finally give non-tiny modern AVRs differential ADC capabilities that let them convincingly best their classic AVR predecessors (the Dx-series ADC in differential mode offered less ad)
* It will be the first modern AVR with RWW/NRWW functionality.
* It will be equipped with a second TCA, even on lower pincount parts. While only adding 3 PWM channels to 28 and 32-pin parts, you also gain the use of the timer to drive events/CCL blocks, which is very powerful.
* It reinforces the garrison established by AVR DD along the border with tinyAVR territory, and rolls ahead with parts with just 8k of flash. This is likely a step towards elimination eliminating "ATtiny" as a brand for new processors, to be replaced by EA, DD, and other part families yet to be announced.
* The event system finally received changes it should have had from day one: most importantly, *channels are now fungible*. It's a real shame that so many parts exist without this, though.
* Did I mention that second TCA1? These things also get 4 TCBs on all pincounts.
  * These thing will be able to output PWM like nobody's business.

### But it could have been a much bigger deal
If only they hadn't downgraded the clock system and CPU core from Dx-like specs to tinyAVR/megaAVR 0-series style 16/20 MHz parts and maximum F_CPU dependent on VDD.... And why none of those spiffy opamps to go with the better analog input capabilities?

### EA support expected to go in smoothly
Core adaptation will mean pulling in the clock speed logic from megaTinyCore, and the fancy-ADC code, and it'll mean some tricky adaptations to Event (the way RTC and Pin events are generated is different, though the specific differences also make the rest of Event simpler - or they *would* except that it's going to be `#ifdef` hell. Actually "going to be" is charitable - it's already there as it is, because while the event system on modern AVRs has *looked* similar, if you just read the feature list, the implementations are quite different.

## The Dx-series architecture
The Dx-series is the first AVR (as far as we know) that does what's quite common among ARM chips in order to support small feature sizes and higher speeds - they use an internal regulator to generate a lower voltage for the chip to run from, and only the I/O runs at the full supply voltage. So it is no surprise that you can vary the supply voltage as much as you like and it won't change the speed of the internal oscillator. Why would it, the oscillator doesn't see any change in voltage, it's running from the internal regulator! As with any regulator (particularly one with virtually no capacitance on the output), a sufficiently dramatic step-change in voltage will cause it to overshoot or undershoot. That's the reason for the maximum slew rate spec: 250 V/ms between 1.8v and the rated maximum voltage. So, if the voltage rail goes from 1.8V to 5V (3.2V) in less than 12.8 microseconds, you would not meet that requirement. This is fast, but plugging a board with minimal decoupling into a very well decoupled power supply can result in such fast rise times. This is why the datasheet suggests a 1uF capacitor in addition to the 0.1uF ones if power will be frequently connected and disconnected; that recommendation was not in the initial datasheet. This limit was rapidly encountered in the field - a small PCB with only the minimum number of 0.1uF capacitors on it that plugs straight into a USB socket could exceed it - and that prompted them to recommend the additional board level decoupling. I consider it prudent to put at least 4.7uF of capacitance on the PCB in general, and this is just another reason to do that.

As you can imagine, this makes implementing MVIO much easier - they just had to sever the connection to Vdd from one port's level shifter bring it to an external pin, and add a BOD-like monitor on that voltage like they already have for VDD. It's worth noting that they don't have any means to internally connect that pin to Vdd when the chip doesn't have MVIO enabled. That's the responsibility of the user. This means that you won't damage the chip if you accidentally forget to enable MVIO before wiring up a dual supply configuration. It also means.... that if you have a different voltage on VDDIO2, PORTC will still use that voltage even if MVIO is off. So what is MVIO doing that takes an extra 400 nA (according to datasheet, peripheral power consumption)? With MVIO on, when the voltage on VDDIO falls below 1.8v, the port turns off and the pins are tristated, and read as zero. That actually seems to be all that MVIO being enabled does - so the extra power consumption is for the equivalent of a brownout detector (BOD) on the VDDIO rail so it can turn the pins off entirely if the voltage on VDDIO2 falls too low for proper operation. With VDDIO2 too low and MVIO off, the pins still try to function, but don't work properly (certainly, they read random values. I haven't tried writing to them; I'm not sure what would happen. Doing this is probably not a good idea - but it appears that putting a chip with MVIO turned off in the fuses into a circuit that uses MVIO will not get immediately harmed, though it may not handle excursions in VDDIO2 gracefully.

It would have been nice if they made MVIO status return a 0 when MVIO was fused off, on the grounds that if you're testing the status of MVIO, you're certainly expecting that you are operating in a multivoltage environment - so it would have been more prudent for the bit to always show zero if MVIO is disabled... or used a second bit. Either of those would have made it much more likely for code to notice, generating an error which would lead the user to investigate and realize that the device had the fuses set wrong. The only time we care about the fuse is when we intend to be making use of MVIO - nobody is going to check it if they're not.
