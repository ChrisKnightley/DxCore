## AVR DD28 - Povery model DB without the opamps and fewer peripherals, but with a bunch of errata fixes and added port mappings

That basically sums up the DD28 and DD32 parts. They're much cheaper than DB-series, barely above ATtiny parts, but come with most of the full suite of features. Obviously some things were cut versus the DB - they still come in three sizes, but the sizes have half the flash. There is only 1 analog comparator and no USART2, and we're down to just one SPI and I2C peripheral. On the other hand, the pin multipleximg options of USART0 and SPI0 have gotten luxury treatment. Note also that the alternate pin mapping numbers don't start at 1.

The 8 pins that the 28-pin parts pick up versus the 20-pin parts are PC0, PD1-3, PF0-1, and 1 each Vdd and Gnd.

### Fully async pins
All pins on the DDs are supposedly fully async, instead of just pins 2 and 6 within each port. Whether this is actually a good thing or not can be debated.

### USART0 mux options
| USART0  | swap |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| DEFAULT | 0    | PA0 | PA1 |  PA2 | PA3 |
| ALT1    | 1    | PA4 | PA5 |  PA6 | PA7 |
| ALT2    | 2    | PA2 | PA3 |   -  |  -  |
| ALT3    | 3    | PD4 | PD5 |  PD6 | PD7 |
| ALT4    | 4    | PC1 | PC2 |  PC3 |  -  |

### USART1 mux options
| USART1  | swap |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| DEFAULT | 0    | PC0 | PC1 |  PC2 | PC3 |
| ALT2    | 2    | PD6 | PD7 |   -  |  -  |

The DEFAULT option is finally useful.

### SPI0 mux options
| SPI0    | swap | MOSI | MISO | SCK |  SS |
|---------|------|------|------|-----|-----|
| DEFAULT | 0    |  PA4 |  PA5 | PA6 | PA7 |
| ALT3    | 3    |  PA0 |  PA1 | PC0 | PC1 |
| ALT4    | 4    |  PD4 |  PD5 | PD6 | PD7 |
| ALT5    | 5    |  PC0 |  PC1 | PC2 | PC3 |
| ALT6    | 6    |  PC1 |  PC2 | PC3 | PF7 |

Suddenly we have 5 usable mux options!

### TWI0 mux options
| Mapping | swap | Master or Slave | Dual Mode Slave |
|---------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| DEFAULT | 0    | SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3 | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 |
| ~ALT1~  | ~1~  | ~SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3~ | ~Not avail.~  |
| ALT2    | 2    | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 | Not avail.      |
| ALT3    | 3    | SDA/PA0 SCL/PA1 | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 |

Note that this means that you want Wire.swap(0, 2, or 3, but not 1).

### PWM Pins
Even with 28 pins, there still isn't a whole lot of choice...
* TCA0 still obviously wants to be on PORTA, the only port with more than half of it's outputs, as the PORTD pins we gained can't do PWM.
* TCD0 can go either way as required, we leave it at default. PF0/1, PD4/5, and PF0/1 are not used for
* The TCBs don't get used for PWM - they share PA2 and PA3 with TCA0, and no different PORTMUX option can return at least the three pins you lose from switching to PORTC instead of PORTA, though they will be used if PORTMUX is set to point TCA0 to a port other than PORTA, and the timer isn't being used for millis, which TCB1 usually is.

#### TCA mux options
| TCA0    | WO0 | WO1 | WO2 | WO3 | WO4 | WO5 |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| PORTA   | PA0 | PA1 | PA2 | PA3 | PA4 | PA5 |
| PORTC   |  -  | PC1 | PC2 | PC3 |  -  |  -  |
| PORTD   |  -  | PD1 | PD2 | PD3 | PD4 | PD5 |
| PORTF   | PF0 | PF1 |  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  |

analogWrite() is "PORTMUX-aware" and if you set `PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA` to a value other than 0, that sets the port to be used. PORTC is 2, PORTD is 3, as you would expect.

#### TCB mux options
| TCBn | Default | Alt |
|------|---------|-----|
| TCB0 |    PA2  |  -  |
| TCB1 |    PA3  |  -  |
| TCB2 |    PC0  |  -  |

Not much of a choice. PC0 is the only one that's useful without changing portmux options, though TCB2 by default is used for millis, though TCB1 is in many ways a better option.

#### TCD0 mux options
| TCD0    | WOA | WOB | WOC | WOD |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| DEFAULT | PA4 | PA5 | PA6 | PA7 |
| ALT2    | PF0 | PF1 |  -  |  -  |
| ALT4    | PA4 | PA5 | PD4 | PD5 |

Like TCA, in 1.5.0 of DxCore, if you set the TCD portmux (`PORTMUX.TCDROUTEA`), digitalWrite and analogWrite() will be aware of it (digitalWriteFast is never aware of PWM, don't use it to shut off PWM, it won't). TCA is used in preference to TCD when both are available on one pin. Since default is usable, we don't change it.

### LED_BUILTIN
To match other parts, `PIN_PA7` shall be the pin that the core "expects" to be connected to an LED **unless** Optiboot is used with the Serial1 Alt2 pinset. In that case, PD7 is used for serial communication, so `PIN_PD5` is used instead. LED_BUILTIN is defined as that pin, and the bootloader will set that pin as output and try to blink the LED. Note that if the bootloader is not used, and your sketch does not reference `LED_BUILTIN` this pin is not otherwise treated any differently.
