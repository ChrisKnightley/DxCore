## AVR DD32 - Povery model DB without the opamps and fewer peripherals, but with a bunch of errata fixes and added port mappings

That basically sums up the DD28 and DD32 parts. They're much cheaper than DB-series, barely above ATtiny parts, but come with most of the full suite of features. Obviously some things were cut versus the DB - they still come in three sizes, but the sizes have half the flash. There is only 1 analog comparator and no USART2, and we're down to just one SPI and I2C peripheral. On the other hand, the pin multipleximg options of USART0 and SPI0 have gotten luxury treatment. Note also that the alternate pin mapping numbers don't start at 1.

The 8 pins that the 28-pin parts pick up versus the 20-pin parts are PC0, PD1-3, PF0-1, and 1 each Vdd and Gnd.

### Fully async pins
All pins on the DDs are supposedly fully async, instead of just pins 2 and 6 within each port. Whether this is actually a good thing or not can be debated.

### USART0 mux options
| USART0  |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| DEFAULT | PA0 | PA1 |  PA2 | PA3 |
| ALT1    | PA4 | PA5 |  PA6 | PA7 |
| ALT2    | PA2 | PA3 |   -  |  -  |
| ALT3    | PD4 | PD5 |  PD6 | PD7 |
| ALT4    | PC1 | PC2 |  PC3 |  -  |


### USART1 mux options
| USART1  |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| DEFAULT | PC0 | PC1 |  PC2 | PC3 |
| ALT2    | PD6 | PD7 |   -  |  -  |


### SPI0 mux options
| SPI0    | MOSI | MISO | SCK |  SS |
|---------|------|------|-----|-----|
| DEFAULT |  PA4 |  PA5 | PA6 | PA7 |
| ALT3    |  PA0 |  PA1 | PC0 | PC1 |
| ALT4    |  PD4 |  PD5 | PD6 | PD7 |
| ALT5    |  PC0 |  PC1 | PC2 | PC3 |
| ALT6    |  PC1 |  PC2 | PC3 | PF7 |

### PWM Pins
Finally, at 32 pins, we see some action in the PWM pins.
* TCA0 can get it's full suite of pins on either PORTA or PORTF. With other peripherals occupying pins on PORTA, we use PORTF by default.
* TCD0 again makes sense on DEFAULT or ALT4 (ALT2 not being used unless TCA is moved elsewhere).
* All TCBs can PWM - though the alt pins overlap with those of TCA0, and one is usually used for millis; if a TCB is used for millis timekeeping, it can't be used for PWM.
* This means by default, PF0-5, PA6-7, and PA2-3 will be available for PWM. Changing the millis timer can get you PWM on PC0, at a cost of less efficient millis timekeeping (using TCA0), or the loss of PWM on PA2 or 3.
