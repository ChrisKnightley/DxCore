## AVR DD32 - Povery model DB without the opamps and fewer peripherals, but with a bunch of errata fixes and added port mappings

That basically sums up the DD28 and DD32 parts. They're much cheaper than DB-series, barely above ATtiny parts, but come with most of the full suite of features. Obviously some things were cut versus the DB - they still come in three sizes, but the sizes have half the flash. There is only 1 analog comparator and no USART2, and we're down to just one SPI and I2C peripheral. On the other hand, the pin multipleximg options of USART0 and SPI0 have gotten luxury treatment. Note also that the alternate pin mapping numbers don't start at 1.

The 8 pins that the 32-pin parts pick up versus the 28-pin parts are PF0-3 - not very exciting for the big-three serial interfaces, but wonderful for PWM, as those largely unpopulated pins on PORTF are perfect for TCA0.

### Fully async pins
All pins on the DDs are supposedly fully async, instead of just pins 2 and 6 within each port. Whether this is actually a good thing or not can be debated.

### USART0 mux options
| USART0  |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| DEFAULT | PA0 | PA1 |  PA2 | PA3 |
| ALT1    | PA4 | PA5 |  PA6 | PA7 |
| ALT2    | PA2 | PA3 |   -  |  -  |
| ALT3    | PD4 | PD5 |  PD6 | PD7 |
| ALT4    | PC1 | PC2 |  PC3 |  -  |


### USART1 mux options
| USART1  |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| DEFAULT | PC0 | PC1 |  PC2 | PC3 |
| ALT2    | PD6 | PD7 |   -  |  -  |


### SPI0 mux options
| SPI0    | MOSI | MISO | SCK |  SS |
|---------|------|------|-----|-----|
| DEFAULT |  PA4 |  PA5 | PA6 | PA7 |
| ALT3    |  PA0 |  PA1 | PC0 | PC1 |
| ALT4    |  PD4 |  PD5 | PD6 | PD7 |
| ALT5    |  PC0 |  PC1 | PC2 | PC3 |
| ALT6    |  PC1 |  PC2 | PC3 | PF7 |


### TWI0 mux options
| Mapping | swap | Master or Slave | Dual Mode Slave |
|---------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| DEFAULT | 0    | SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3 | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 |
| ~ALT1~  | ~1~  | ~SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3~ | ~Not avail.~  |
| ALT2    | 2    | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 | Not avail.      |
| ALT3    | 3    | SDA/PA0 SCL/PA1 | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 |

Note that this means that you want Wire.swap(0, 2, or 3, but not 1).

### PWM Pins
Finally, at 32 pins, we see some action in the PWM pins.
* TCA0 can get it's full suite of pins on either PORTA or PORTF. With other peripherals occupying pins on PORTA, we use PORTF by default.
* TCD0 again makes sense on DEFAULT or ALT4 (ALT2 not being used unless TCA is moved elsewhere).
* All TCBs can PWM - though the alt pins overlap with those of TCA0, and one is usually used for millis; if a TCB is used for millis timekeeping, it can't be used for PWM.
* This means by default, PF0-5, PA6-7, and PA2-3 will be available for PWM. Changing the millis timer can get you PWM on PC0, at a cost of less efficient millis timekeeping (using TCA0), or the loss of PWM on PA2 or 3.

#### TCA0 mux options
The Type A timers (TCA0) can be mapped to different pins as a group only, and analogWrite() is PORTMUX-aware - you can set TCA0 to output on any port's pin 0-5. Using this feature is easy - you simply write to the portmux register `PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = (TCA0 pinset)` and then analogWrite() normally. TCA0 pinset is the port number (0-5 for ports A-F), or one of the named constants of the form: PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTx_gc where x is A, C, D or F.

| TCA0    | WO0 | WO1 | WO2 | WO3 | WO4 | WO5 |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| PORTA   | PA0 | PA1 | PA2 | PA3 | PA4 | PA5 |
| PORTC   |  -  | PC1 | PC2 | PC3 |  -  |  -  |
| PORTD   |  -  | PD1 | PD2 | PD3 | PD4 | PD5 |
| PORTF   | PF0 | PF1 | PF2 | PF3 | PF4 | PF5 |

It is strongly recommended to not have any PWM output enabled involving either the timer being moved nor the pins it is being moved to when setting `PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA`. In the latter case, you will not be able to turn off the existing PWM through the API functions. Simple assignment can and should be used to write to the PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA register. This is the only bitfield there, so you needn't worry about stomping on anything else.

#### TCB mux options
| TCBn | Default | Alt |
|------|---------|-----|
| TCB0 | **PA2** | PF4 |
| TCB1 | **PA3** | PF5 |
| TCB2 | **PC0** |  -  |

Default mappings are used, since PF4/5 are shared with the preferred TCA pins, which take priority. These are NOT PORTMUX-aware. Only the **bold** pin can be used without modifying or creating a new variant file.

The type B timers are much better utility timers than PWM timers. TCB2 is the default millis timer and cannot be used for PWM in that mode.

#### TCD0 mux options
| TCD0    | WOA | WOB | WOC | WOD |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| DEFAULT | PA4 | PA5 | PA6 | PA7 |
| ALT2    | PF0 | PF1 | PF2 | PF3 |
| ALT4    | PA4 | PA5 | PD4 | PD5 |

Like TCA, in 1.5.0 of DxCore, if you set the TCD portmux (`PORTMUX.TCDROUTEA`), digitalWrite and analogWrite() will be aware of it (digitalWriteFast is never aware of PWM, don't use it to shut off PWM, it won't). TCA is used in preference to TCD when both are available on one pin. Since default is usable, we don't change it.

### LED_BUILTIN
To match other parts, `PIN_PA7` shall be the pin that the core "expects" to be connected to an LED **unless** Optiboot is used with the Serial1 Alt2 pinset. In that case, PD7 is used for serial communication, so `PIN_PD5` is used instead. LED_BUILTIN is defined as that pin, and the bootloader will set that pin as output and try to blink the LED. Note that if the bootloader is not used, and your sketch does not reference `LED_BUILTIN` this pin is not otherwise treated any differently. If you want to have a different pin be recognized by the application (this does not change the bootloader - you would still need to do a custom build of that too), this can be overridden if a custom board definition is created by passing `-DLED_BUILTIN=(some other pin)` as part of build_extra_flags, building via the CLI, or by equivslent means provided by other third party development environments.
